# Mondo-Library
PHP Library Class for accessing data in Mondo API
Currently this library handles OAuth authentication, as well as pulling acount details and a few other bits of information from the API.

This is a learning experience for me. I an trying to abstract as much logic as possible into this class so that I can easily make a web interface to my banking/transactions.

The Mondo API is still in Beta so this may break overnight as they change the API.
